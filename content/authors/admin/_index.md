I am a PhD student at Ruhr University Bochum (RUB), Germany, in the DFG Cluster of Excellence “Cyber Security in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries“ (CASA). 

I am interested in cryptography and in particular in provable security. My research focuses on the design and analysis of cryptographic protocols.
