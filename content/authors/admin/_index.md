I am a tenure-track faculty at [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en). My research focuses on the foundations of applied cryptography and in particular on provable security. I contribute to analyzing real-world cryptographic schemes to improve their theoretical security guarantees. Additionally, I design new schemes and protocols for practice, which often requires the formalization of new or stronger security models.

More specifically, I enjoy working on any kind of key exchange protocols including their use in secure messaging, often with a focus on game-based security definitions and tight security proofs. I am also generally interested in public-key encryption with advanced functionalities, like updatable (public-key) encryption and attribute-based encryption. I am lucky to have collaborated with inspiring researchers on these topics and I also engaged in interdisciplinary research projects. Before joining CISPA, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego working with [Mihir Bellare](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/index.html). I completed my PhD in the research group of [Eike Kiltz](https://informatik.rub.de/kiltz/) at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. I did a virtual internship at NTT Research and visited UC Berkeley, University of Washington and NTNU Trondheim.
